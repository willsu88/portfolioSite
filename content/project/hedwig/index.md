This is a project I built with a team of 7 at [RiceApps](https://riceapps.org/) throughout my sophomore year of college. Our motivation stemmed from the fact that although there are multiple food and drinks vendor on campus, none of them offer a delivery option (which is something that many students want). Without pitching the idea of delivery directly to these vendors, we decided to meet with them and ask them what their biggest needs are currently. Interestingly enough, 2 of the 3 vendors we met with told us that delivery is the biggest challenge they want to resolve. 

As apps like UberEats and Postmates are all too large scaled for our relatively small campus, we decided to build our own app for them. In reality, we actually needed to build two apps: one for the vendors to use and one for the users to use. The project has gone through a beta deployment and some students have already used the app to order Boba right to their dorm! 

Because the 7 of us all had to learn new technology throughout the process, our roles quite often shifted around from backend to front end or the vendor app to the user app. As I got more comfortable with the technology, my role began to primarily focus on the Vendor App and use [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) as an abstraction layer to connect the backend with the frontend. 

Check out the links at the top to see the [code base](https://github.com/rice-apps/RiceDeliveryVendorFrontEnd) for the Vendor App and a [video demo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wIgvWTD4RLgvhK0BUfyctZOtwMjRo7Cd) of the beta app!
