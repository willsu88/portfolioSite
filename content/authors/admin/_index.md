Hi all! I am currently a student at Rice University majoring in Computer Science (graduating Dec. 2020). It has been almost 4 years since I wrote my first line of code and printed "Hello World!".

Since then, I've had the opportunity to tutor other students in CS, take graduate-level classes, and work on a few programming projects at school & during internships. All the time, I am still fascinated by new technologies in software and computers. I look foward to always learning more and discovering what I can build.
