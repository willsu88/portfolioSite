Hey! I am a CS student studying at Rice University in Houston, Texas. It has been around three years since I wrote my first line of code - yup, it was print "Hello World". To this day, I'm still always fascinated by how valuable and powerful software programs can be and love learning new technologies.

In particular, I am interested in the crossroad of software engineering, data science, and social good. How and why do my few lines of code matter? I aspire to put these doubts to the test and bring meaningful products to life.
