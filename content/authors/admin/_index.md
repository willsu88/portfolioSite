I am a CS student currently studying at Rice University in Houston TX, USA. It has been around 3 years since I wrote my first line of code and was half-amused that the console does indeed spit back "hello world!". Since then, I've worked on a few projects at school & internships, taken some high-level CS classes, and grown to become more fascinated by how powerful software programs can be. 

Welcome to my site!
