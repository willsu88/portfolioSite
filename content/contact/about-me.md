Hey friend, welcome to my site!

This website is primarily used to document my projects, keep track of the work/volunteer experiences I’ve had over the years, and perhaps offer a little glimpse into my mind ;) 

Aside from tech, I also enjoy playing basketball & swimming, reading by the pool, and traveling with family & friends. Living off-campus for the first time, I’ve also recently picked up cooking. For now, I’m finding it pretty fun, but who knows when I’ll get sick of my own food?

Here's a snapshot of my favorites:
